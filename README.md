# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

In this project/competition I predicted whether a passenger was likely to survive the Titanic disaster based on features like their gender, age, price of their ticket etc. 
The data was provided by Kaggle.

## Dependencies:

pandas
numpy
pyplot
LogisticRegression (from sklearn.linear_model)
train_test_split (from sklearn.model_selection)
StandardScaler (from sklearn.preprocessing)
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
